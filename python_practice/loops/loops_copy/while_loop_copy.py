# While Loop

 # While loop can be used to Iterate over Iterable objects or Sequences ( list, tuples, strings, sets, etc  )
 # While loop can be used to repeatly run a Block of code untill the Specified condition is met

 # While Loop Providing conditions can be Classfied into 3 Types
  # 1. In the While Loop Line 
  # 2. Inside the While Loop as a Base Case
  # 3. Writing conditions in a Variable then using that variable in a [ while ] condition


# Types of While Loop

 # Regular While Loop
  # this is the regular while loop where we will be providing the conditions on the while line itself, This can be used to iterate over Iteraable Objects or Sequences
  # This type of loop can be used to To Iterate over Iterable Objects or Sequences such as [ list, strings, tuples, sets, etc ]

 # Infinite While Loop
   # In this type of loop we will be writing the while codition inside the Loop ( as a Base Case ), so every when we run the loop, while loop checks the conditions which inside the loop based on it loops moves( decides weather to mover or not ) to the Next line
   # This type of loop can be used to Evaluate User Input, and keep running the While loop untill the condition is Met by providing appropriate values.
