        # Imformations [ <Form> Tag ] :-
        1. All the HTTP Methods such as [ GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH ] will only work in form tags, we are not allowed to use this methods inside other tags 
        2. If you want to get some datas from the Frontend to Backend, make sure to wrap [ Form ] tags and Appropriate tagas inside the [ Form ] tag from which we are going to get the datas, ex : [ input, etc ].
        3. To send the data from Backend to Frontend, you don't need to append inside any tags, We can directly access it from appropriate request methods such as [ Get ], which Flask or other libraries will provide.  
        # only [ <Form> tag ] can be used to perform Http requests.

            if you the [ form ] element to be treated as [ POST, DELETE, PATCH, etc ] make sure to use [ method ] attribute and pass appropriate request values such as [ POST, DELETE, PATCH ].
